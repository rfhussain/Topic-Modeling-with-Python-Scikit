# Machine Learning

This term is used for the Set of Algorithms which are used for the betterment of a system. These Set of Algorithms train on the data available with you and then gets applied on the Test Data to perform Prediction. The Prediction done by these Algorithms will then be used for the betterment of the Application/System.
To know better about Machine Learning, you can always browse numerous articles available on the web. 

## Supervised Machine Learning

This is a kind of Machine Learning which depends on the fact that you have historical Data available with you. It learns on that data, different sets of algorithms are used on the available data, and to note that which applied algorithms is bringing back results which are nearer to the results available already in the historical data. 

Upon acheiving the desired results, the Machine Learning Model will be applied on the Test Data, to do the Predictions. The results will then be measured in different ways such as Confusion Matrix and Accuracy report etc. 

Once you are confident of the results, the Machine Learning Model will then be deployed to the Production.

## Un-Supervised Machine Learning

Unlike the Supervised Learning, in this case you do not have any historical data to train on, instead it trains and fits on the Model and provides the predictions. 

Our article and code for the Topic Modeling falls under the same category. 

If you want to go in more details on Un-supervised Machine Learning, then you can  always browse numerous articles available on the web.
